            "transcript": "I'll make two points. The first is, you mentioned Haj Amin al Husseini and his, collaboration with the Nazis. Entirely legitimate point to raise, But I think one can also say definitively had Hajj I mean, al Husseini never existed, the holocaust would have played out precisely Certainly. As it did. Certainly. As far as Palestinian opposition to Jewish immigration to Palestine, during the nineteen thirties is concerned, it was of a different character than, for example, British and American, rejection of, Jewish immigration. They just didn't want Jews on their soil. Objectively, it helped the Germans kill the Jews. In the Palestinian case, their opposition to Jewish immigration was to prevent the transformation of their homeland into a Jewish state that would dispossess them. And I think that's an important distinction to make. The other point I wanted to make is we've we've spent the past several hours talking about, Zionism transfer and so on, but I think there's a more fundamental aspect to this, which is that, Zionism, I think, would have emerged and disappeared as yet one more utopian political project Had it not been for the British, what the preeminent Palestinian historian, Waleed Khalidi, has termed the British shield. Because I think without the British sponsorship, we wouldn't be having this discussion today. The British, sponsored Zionism for a very simple reason, which is that during World War one, the Ottoman armies attempted to march on the Suez Canal. Suez Canal was the jugular vein of, the British Empire, you know, between, Europe and India. And the British came to the conclusion that they needed to secure the Suez Canal from any threat. And as the British have done so often in so many places, how do you deal with this? Well, you know, you you bring in a, foreign minority, implant them amongst a hostile, population, and establish a protectorate over them. I don't think, a Jewish state in Palestine had been part of British intentions, and the Balfour Declaration very specifically speaks about a Jewish national home in Palestine. In other words, a British protectorate. Things ended up taking a different course, and I think the the the most important development was, World War two, and I think this had maybe less to do with the holocaust and more to do with the effective bankruptcy of The United Kingdom, during that war and its inability to sustain, its global empire. It ended up giving up India, ended up giving up, Palestine. And it's in that context, I think, that we need to see, the emergence of a, of a Jewish state in Palestine. And, again, a Jewish state means a state in which the Jewish community enjoys, not only a demographic majority, but an uncontestable demographic majority, an uncontestable territorial, hegemony, and an uncontestable political supremacy. And that is also why after 1948, the nascent Israeli state confiscated, I believe, up to 90% of, lands that had been previously owned, by Palestinians who became citizens of Israel. It is why the new Israeli state imposed a military government on its population of Palestinian citizens between 1948 and 1966. It is why the Israeli state effectively reduced, the Palestinians living within the Israeli state as citizens of the Israeli state to second class citizens, on the one hand promoting Jewish nationalism and Jewish nationalist parties, on the other hand doing everything within its power to suppress and eliminate Palestinian or Arab, nationalist movements. And that's why today there's a consensus among all major human rights organizations that Israel is an apartheid state. With the Israeli human rights organization, B'Tselem describes a regime of Jewish supremacy between the river Yes. And the sea. You're you're really tempting response from the other side on on the last few sentences. And we'll talk this. Yeah. Okay. We'll talk about the claims of of apartheid and so on. It's a fascinating discussion. We need to have it. Norm? On the question of the responsibility of the Palestinian Arabs for the Nazi holocaust direct or indirect, I consider that an absurd claim. As Gromyko said, and I quoted him, the entire Western world turned its back on the Jews to somehow focus on the Palestinian strikes me as completely ridiculous. Number two, as Muin said, there's a perfectly understandable reason why Palestinian Arabs wouldn't want Jews because in their minds and not irrationally, these Jews intended to create a Jewish state, which would quite likely have resulted in their expulsion. I'm a very generous person. I've actually taken in a homeless person for two and a half years. But if I knew in advance that that homeless person was going to try to turn me out of my apartment, I would think 10,000 times before I took him in. Okay? As far as the actual, complicity of the Palestinian Arabs, if you look at, Raul Hilberg's three volume classic work, The Destruction of the European Jury, he has in those thousand plus pages, one sentence, one sentence on the role of the Mufti of Jerusalem. And that I think is probably an overstatement, but we'll leave it aside. The only two points I would make aside from the Holocaust point is, number one, I do think the transfer discussion is useful because it indicates that there was a rational reason behind the Arab resistance to Jewish or Zionist immigration to Palestine, the fear of territorial displacement and dispossession. And number two, there are two issues. One is the history, and the second is being responsible for your words. Now some people accuse me of speaking very slowly, and they're advised on YouTube to turn up the speed twice to three times whenever I'm on. One of the reasons I speak slowly is because I attach value to every word I say. And it is discomforting, disorienting, where you have a person who's produced a voluminous corpus, rich in insights and rich in archival sources, who seems to disown each and every word that you pluck from that corpus by claiming that it's either out of context or it's cherry picking words count. And I agree with Lex. Everybody has the right to rescind what they've said in the past. But what you cannot claim is that you didn't say what you said. I'll stick to the history, not the current propaganda. 1917, the British the Zionist movement began way before the British supported the Zionist movement for decades. In 1917, the British jumped in and issued the the Balfour Declaration supporting the emergence of a Jewish, national home in Palestine, which most people understood to mean eventual Jewish statehood in Palestine. Most people understood that in Britain and in along the Zionists and among the Arabs. But the British declared the Balfour Declaration or issued the Balfour Declaration not only because of imperial self interest, and this is what you're basically saying. They had the imperial interests, a buffer state, which would protect the Suez Canal from the East. The British also were motivated by idealism. And this, incidentally, is how Balfour described the reasoning behind issuing the declaration. And he said, the Western world, Western Christendom, owes the Jews a great debt, both for giving, the the world and the West, if you like, values, social values, as as embodied in the the Bible, social justice and all sorts of other things. And the Christian world owes the Jews because it persecuted them for two thousand years. This debt, we're now beginning to repay with the 1917 declaration favoring Zionism. But it's also worth remembering that the Jews, weren't proxies or attached to the British, imperial endeavor. They were happy to receive British support in 1917, and then subsequently when the British ruled Palestine for twenty, thirty years, but they weren't part of the British imperial design or mission. They wanted a state for themselves. The Jews, happy to have the British support them, happy today to have the Americans support Israel. But it's not because we're stooges or extensions of American imperial interests. The British, incidentally, always described in Arab, narratives of propaganda as consistent supporters of Zionism. They weren't. The first British rulers in Palestine, 1917, 1920 Herbert Samuel. No. Before Herbert Samuel. Samuel came in 1920. The British ruled there for three years previously, and most of the leaders, the British generals and so on, who were in Palestine were anti Zionist. And subsequently, in the twenties and thirties, the British occasionally, curbed Zionist immigration to Palestine. And in 1939, switched horses and supported the Arab national movement and not Zionism. They turned anti Zionist and basically said, you Arabs will rule Palestine within the next ten years. This is what we're giving you by limiting Jewish immigration to Palestine. But the Arabs didn't actually understand what they were being given on a silver platter, Husseini again. And he said, no. No. We can't accept the British white paper of May 1939, which had given the Arabs everything they wanted, basically, self determination in an Arab majority state. So what I'm saying is the British, at some point, did support the Zionist enterprise, but at other points were less consistent than the support. And in 1939 until 1948 when they didn't vote even for partition for Jewish statehood in Palestine in the UN resolution, they didn't support Zionism during the last decade of the mandate. It's worth remembering that. I I'd like to respond to that. I mean, speaking of propaganda, I find it simply impossible to accept, that Balfour, who as British prime minister in nineteen o five was a chief sponsor of the Aliens Act, which was specifically He changed his mind. Which was specifically designed to keep To keep up Jewish. Persecuted Eastern European Jews out of the streets So he changed his mind. And who was denounced as an antisemite by the entire British Jewish establishment. A decade later, all of a sudden Changed his mind. The people change their minds. But when the when when when the changing of the mind just coincidentally happens to coincide, with the British imperial interest, I think perhaps the transformation is is is a little more superficial than he's being given credit for. It it was clearly a British imperial venture, and if there had been no threat to the Suez Canal during World War one, regardless of what Balfour would have thought about the Jews and their contribution to, history and their and their persecution and so on, there would have been no Balfour there. And that's real quick as a question on that. Why did the British ever cap immigration then from Jews to that area at all? Well, we're talking now about 2019 sure. But I'm saying that if it was if the whole goal was just to be an imperialist project, like, there were terrorist attacks from Jewish, firms. But you're you're so I'll answer you. Yeah. And we're talking now about 1917. And and as I mentioned earlier, I don't think the British had a Jewish state in mind. That's why they used the term Jewish national home. I think what they wanted was a British protectorate, loyal to and dependent upon, the British. I think an outstanding, review of British policy towards these issues during the mandate has been done by Martin Bunton of the University of Victoria. And and he basically makes the argument, that once the British realized the mess they were in, certainly by the late twenties, early thirties, they they recognized these the mess they were in, the irreconcilable differences, and basically pursued a policy of just muddling on. And and, and muddling on in the context of British rule in Palestine, whose overall purpose was to serve, for the development of of Zionist institutions, Yeshiva's economy, and so on, meant, even if the British, were not self consciously doing this, preparing the groundwork for the eventual establishment of a Jewish state. I don't know if that answers your question. Except they did turn anti Zionist in 1939. Yes. Of course. Of course. Of course. Of course. Of course. They were being shot off by And maintained that Zionist no. No. Before they were being shot off, but maintained that anti Zionist posture until 1948. Okay. And and if I may, just also one point. You mentioned Haj Amin al Husseini during a world entirely legitimate. But what I but what I would also point point out is that you had a Zionist organization, the Leahy. 300 people. 300 people, one of whom happened to become an Israeli prime minister, an Israeli foreign minister, speaker of Israeli parliament. Maybe you should give his name. Yitzhak Shamir, proposing an alliance with Nazi Germany in 1941. Shamir proposed the Well, no. The Leahy proposed. Some people in the Leahy proposed Of which Shamir was a prominent leader. Herring also. No. No. Okay. Well, if he's a red herring, had to be seen as a red whale. I'm sorry. The Lekki was an unimportant organization in the issue. 300 people versus 30,000 belong to the Haganah. So it was not a very important organization. It's true. Before the Holocaust actually began, they wanted allies against the British where they could find them in the end of the nineteenth. 41 here, not 1931. 40. 41 from what I recall. 1940. They were they approached the the The the emissary in Istanbul or something. Yes. Istanbul. And and and if I may, proposed an alliance with Nazi Germany on what the Leahy described as on the basis of shared ideological shared ideological principles. Well, they said they did. No. They did revile Why are you doing these things? Of course. Said you know the state, but you know that vile. You know what the statement said on the basis of a shared ideology. Why do you say no? Do you think that the Mexicans wait. The Mexicans say we're Nazis. Is that what they're saying? They said you say that. No. You're saying that. Forget statements. You like to quote things, but were they were they Nazis? Quote facts. Where are the where are the Nazi Nazis? That's what I'm asking. What did he say? Some of them said what did Stalin say incident basis of the pact? Was there agreement on ideology? There wasn't any pact. They suggested. I said it was agreement. And what did the agreement say? They wanted arms against the British. That's what they wanted to do. Well, that's what Hoseidon and Hosseini wanted also. That's what No. No. But they they didn't work in India. People didn't work in Berlin, helping the Nazi regime. I mean, that's what the IRA wanted also. But this is what Khatramina Ali Amina Husseini did. You know that he was an anti Semite. You've probably read some of his works. Yeah. He wasn't just anti British. And and He was also anti Semitic. And and the They had a common ground with Hitler. I I think I think we can agree. Every anti Semite is a Hitlerite. I think we could part He literally worked with the Nazis to recruit people. He wasn't just a guy posting or absolutely revolting, disgusting human beings. This I'm happy to hear. No. But the problem is you're inquiring. You're saying that Hussein was his influence. You're saying the movie was I I don't even understand. Of all the crimes you want to ascribe to the Palestinian people, trying to blame them directly, indirectly, indirectly, or indirectly, three times removed for the Nazi holocaust is completely lunatic. Hold on. The wait. There's not a he's not blaming them for the holocaust. He's saying that from the perspective wait. Wait. Wait. No. He's saying that from the perspective of Jews in the region, Palestinians would have been part of the region. That is exactly what he said. I've read him. You never understand him. He's just right here. Believe me. I'm a lot more literate than you, mister Barrelli. Believe the guy that wrote the stuff. The Wikipedia said. That's great. I read that he's Hebrew. You call yourself an Israeli historian. I I I wrong. You're on a different ground. I just want if I can just respond to No. No. No. I'm just saying that the there there were two there were two tricks. There were that's fine. There were two tricks that are being played here that I think is interesting. One is you guys claim that the Leahy was trying to forge an alliance with Nazi Germany because of a shared ideology. That's what they said. Yeah. But hold on. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. It's about what you said. You brought that up to imply that Zionism must be inexorably linked to no. I'm sorry. Wait. No. You're putting words in my mouth. No. No. No. Okay. Wait. Well, then what was the purpose of of saying that the Lehi claimed that they the Lehi who were The reason I called the people that were reviled by many in Israel In not many, by everybody practically. They were called terrorists. So reviled. Communist movement called them terrorists. Yes. Yes. And and Hamid And Hamid, the premier of Shamir called himself a terrorist. They were so irrelevant that their leader ended up being kicked upstairs to the leader of the Israeli parliament That's Israeli parliament to the Israel years in. To Israeli foreign minister. And And also a par Yes. You wanna you wanna characterize him as irrelevant as well? Go ahead. No. Characterizing him as relevant or irrelevant based on what happens decades later. The timeline matters. Well The question is, what is the point of saying that the Lahey tried to forge an alliance with a wall of solidarity? Why is why is irrelevant is bringing up the Mufti of Jerusalem and trying to blame the Holocaust No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. The Mufti was the leader of the Palestine Arab national movement. The Iraqi was triumphed. And he had as much to do with the Nazi Holocaust as I did. No. He recruited people for the SS. How can you get away from them? No. He recruited soldiers People for the SS. He recruited soldiers in the Balkans, mostly Kosovars, which was disgusting. I have no doubt about that. But he had one He don't let any foreign major one said say don't let the Jews out. I do not want him to stop talking about the murder. I do not want to stop talking about the received letters from Husseini during during the Holocaust. Once said During the Holocaust, don't let the Jews out. Don't let the Jews out. I'm not saying he was a major architect of the holocaust. Minor. But if we're agreed statements. If we're agreed Yes. That Haj Amin al Husseini, the Mufti of Jerusalem, collaborated with the Nazis during World War two and actively sought their sponsorship. Why is it irrelevant? And probably wanted the destruction of European Jewry. He probably wanted a lot of things. Okay. Okay? If that's relevant, why is it irrelevant that a prime minister of Israel Not prime minister. Nineteen forty forty one, he wasn't prime minister of Israel. He was a leader of a very small terrorist So do you consider terrorists terrorist by the name of Zionists. Do you consider it irrelevant that many years ago, Mahmoud Abbas wrote a doctoral thesis, which is basically tantamount about Mahmoud Abbas. Okay. But But I don't but didn't bring it up. You're the one who's bringing it up. Yes. I'm But you consider that one? Belittling the holocaust. That's what you're saying. The president president of the Palestinian National Authority belittled the holocaust and it didn't happen or only a few Jews died. That's a fair characterization of But I didn't bring it up. I brought it up. Yeah. Okay? Because my question is, then why is Shamir's antecedency relevant? He he was a terrorist leader of a very small marginal group. But because Shamir is he was the head of the movement at the time. Also, the the point of bringing it misunderstanding. The point of bringing it Husseini's stuff wasn't to say that he was a great further of the holocaust. It's that he might have been a great further in the prevention of Jews fleeing to go to Palestine to escape the holocaust. That was the that was the point. That and I explained why I think, that's that's not an entirely, accurate characterization. But and then I wanted to make another point. If it's legitimate to bring up his role during World War two, why is it illegitimate to bring up a man who would become Israel's speaker of parliament, foreign minister Yes. Four years since. Why is it and and also He was young. And was also responsible for the murder of of the United Nations' first international envoy, Bernadotte, Focke Bernadotte. Why is all that irrelevant? I don't think anybody can see what it is. I think that the just the the reason why he was brought up was because Jewish people at the in this time period would have viewed it as, there's a prevention of Jews leaving Europe because of the Palestinians pressuring the British to put a curb that 75,000, immigration limit. Yes. But it's not about, like, it's not about them furthering the holocaust or being an architect, major minor play in the holocaust. Well, I actually We use a major play in that region. So what is going on, like Morris was specific made the specific claim that the Palestinians played an indirect role in the Holocaust. The indirect role would have been the prevention of people escaping from Yes. Your And and my response to that is, first of all, I I disagree with that characterization. But second of all disagree with that. They prevented they forced the British to prevent immigration of Jews from Europe and reaching safe shores in Palestine. Well, again they did. Again, was And they knew that the Was Palestine been persecuted in Europe. Was Palestine the only spot of land on Earth? Yes. Basically, that was the problem. The Jews couldn't enter the Europe. What about your great friends in Britain, the architects of of the Balfour Declaration? By the late nineteen thirties What about The United States? Happy to take in Jews and the Americans? And and and why and why are Palestinians, who were not Europeans, who had zero role in the rise of Nazism, who had no relation to any of this, why are they somehow uniquely responsible for what happened in Europe and uniquely to cope with the only safe haven for Jews. That's true. Really, The United States wasn't a say a potential stay safe haven. The only one was Palestine. At the party The United States had no room from the Atlantic Pacific for Jews. It did have room, but it didn't So that wasn't the But it didn't want safe haven. This is something be focusing your anger should be blamed for not letting Jews in during the thirties. Are blamed, but nobody blames them for the holocaust. Well, indirectly, indirectly I've never heard it said that Franklin Delano Roosevelt was indirectly responsible for the holocaust. I never heard that. Now maybe it's in Israeli literature because the Israelis have gone mad. Your yes. Your prime minister said the whole idea of the gas chambers came from the Mufti of Jerusalem. That's nonsense. Yeah. We all know that. Nonsense. But we also know that Netanyahu said Netanyahu says Netanyahu says so many things which are And he happens to be the prime minister of Israel. I can't be responsible for them. Not responsible for them, but it is relevant that he is the longest serving prime minister of Israel. Unfortunately, he says that about the Israeli public. Right? And he gets and he gets selected, not despite saying such things, but because he says such His voters don't care about Hajime al Husseini or Hitler. They know nothing about his voters. Be right. His base know nothing about know nothing about anything. And he can say what he likes, and they'll say yes, so they don't care if he says these things. You may well be right. But but but, anyway, not to beat a dead horse, but I don't I I still don't understand. Dead horse. You're right. I I'll just conclude by saying, I don't understand why the Mufti of Jerusalem is relevant. He is relevant. He is relevant. But The head of the national Shahrym Shahrym Shahrym Shahrym Shahrym Shahrym Shahrym Shahrym Shahrym Shahrym Shahrym Shahrym Shahrym Shahrym Shah at the time. The fact that thirty years later, he becomes prime minister, that's the quirks of of history. And his and his history. Khosseini was the head of the Palestine Arab National Movement at the time. Anyway, I What can you do? I think we're speaking past each other. We're not. We're not talking facts.",

              "transcript": "\nSpeaker 0: I'll make two points. The first is, you mentioned Haj Amin al Husseini and his, collaboration with the Nazis. Entirely legitimate point to raise, But I think one can also say definitively had Hajj I mean, al Husseini never existed, the holocaust would have played out precisely\n\nSpeaker 1: Certainly.\n\nSpeaker 0: As it did. Certainly. As far as Palestinian opposition to Jewish immigration to Palestine, during the nineteen thirties is concerned, it was of a different character than, for example, British and American, rejection of, Jewish immigration. They just didn't want Jews on their soil.\n\nSpeaker 1: Objectively, it helped the Germans kill the Jews.\n\nSpeaker 0: In the Palestinian case, their opposition to Jewish immigration was to prevent the transformation of their homeland into a Jewish state that would dispossess them. And I think that's an important distinction to make. The other point I wanted to make is we've we've spent the past several hours talking about, Zionism transfer and so on, but I think there's a more fundamental aspect to this, which is that, Zionism, I think, would have emerged and disappeared as yet one more utopian political project Had it not been for the British, what the preeminent Palestinian historian, Waleed Khalidi, has termed the British shield. Because I think without the British sponsorship, we wouldn't be having this discussion today. The British, sponsored Zionism for a very simple reason, which is that during World War one, the Ottoman armies attempted to march on the Suez Canal.\n\nSuez Canal was the jugular vein of, the British Empire, you know, between, Europe and India. And the British came to the conclusion that they needed to secure the Suez Canal from any threat. And as the British have done so often in so many places, how do you deal with this? Well, you know, you you bring in a, foreign minority, implant them amongst a hostile, population, and establish a protectorate over them. I don't think, a Jewish state in Palestine had been part of British intentions, and the Balfour Declaration very specifically speaks about a Jewish national home in Palestine.\n\nIn other words, a British protectorate. Things ended up taking a different course, and I think the the the most important development was, World War two, and I think this had maybe less to do with the holocaust and more to do with the effective bankruptcy of The United Kingdom, during that war and its inability to sustain, its global empire. It ended up giving up India, ended up giving up, Palestine. And it's in that context, I think, that we need to see, the emergence of a, of a Jewish state in Palestine. And, again, a Jewish state means a state in which the Jewish community enjoys, not only a demographic majority, but an uncontestable demographic majority, an uncontestable territorial, hegemony, and an uncontestable political supremacy.\n\nAnd that is also why after 1948, the nascent Israeli state confiscated, I believe, up to 90% of, lands that had been previously owned, by Palestinians who became citizens of Israel. It is why the new Israeli state imposed a military government on its population of Palestinian citizens between 1948 and 1966. It is why the Israeli state effectively reduced, the Palestinians living within the Israeli state as citizens of the Israeli state to second class citizens, on the one hand promoting Jewish nationalism and Jewish nationalist parties, on the other hand doing everything within its power to suppress and eliminate Palestinian or Arab, nationalist movements. And that's why today there's a consensus among all major human rights organizations that Israel is an apartheid state. With the Israeli human rights organization, B'Tselem describes a regime of Jewish supremacy between the river Yes.\n\nAnd the sea. You're you're really tempting\n\nSpeaker 2: response from the other side on on the last few sentences. And we'll\n\nSpeaker 1: talk this. Yeah. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: We'll talk about the claims of of apartheid and so on. It's a fascinating discussion. We need to have it. Norm?\n\nSpeaker 3: On the question of the responsibility of the Palestinian Arabs for the Nazi holocaust direct or indirect, I consider that an absurd claim. As Gromyko said, and I quoted him, the entire Western world turned its back on the Jews to somehow focus on the Palestinian strikes me as completely ridiculous. Number two, as Muin said, there's a perfectly understandable reason why Palestinian Arabs wouldn't want Jews because in their minds and not irrationally, these Jews intended to create a Jewish state, which would quite likely have resulted in their expulsion. I'm a very generous person. I've actually taken in a homeless person for two and a half years.\n\nBut if I knew in advance that that homeless person was going to try to turn me out of my apartment, I would think 10,000 times before I took him in. Okay? As far as the actual, complicity of the Palestinian Arabs, if you look at, Raul Hilberg's three volume classic work, The Destruction of the European Jury, he has in those thousand plus pages, one sentence, one sentence on the role of the Mufti of Jerusalem. And that I think is probably an overstatement, but we'll leave it aside. The only two points I would make aside from the Holocaust point is, number one, I do think the transfer discussion is useful because it indicates that there was a rational reason behind the Arab resistance to Jewish or Zionist immigration to Palestine, the fear of territorial displacement and dispossession.\n\nAnd number two, there are two issues. One is the history, and the second is being responsible for your words. Now some people accuse me of speaking very slowly, and they're advised on YouTube to turn up the speed twice to three times whenever I'm on. One of the reasons I speak slowly is because I attach value to every word I say. And it is discomforting, disorienting, where you have a person who's produced a voluminous corpus, rich in insights and rich in archival sources, who seems to disown each and every word that you pluck from that corpus by claiming that it's either out of context or it's cherry picking words count.\n\nAnd I agree with Lex. Everybody has the right to rescind what they've said in the past. But what you cannot claim is that you didn't say what you said.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll stick to the history, not the current propaganda. 1917, the British the Zionist movement began way before the British supported the Zionist movement for decades. In 1917, the British jumped in and issued the the Balfour Declaration supporting the emergence of a Jewish, national home in Palestine, which most people understood to mean eventual Jewish statehood in Palestine. Most people understood that in Britain and in along the Zionists and among the Arabs. But the British declared the Balfour Declaration or issued the Balfour Declaration not only because of imperial self interest, and this is what you're basically saying.\n\nThey had the imperial interests, a buffer state, which would protect the Suez Canal from the East. The British also were motivated by idealism. And this, incidentally, is how Balfour described the reasoning behind issuing the declaration. And he said, the Western world, Western Christendom, owes the Jews a great debt, both for giving, the the world and the West, if you like, values, social values, as as embodied in the the Bible, social justice and all sorts of other things. And the Christian world owes the Jews because it persecuted them for two thousand years.\n\nThis debt, we're now beginning to repay with the 1917 declaration favoring Zionism. But it's also worth remembering that the Jews, weren't proxies or attached to the British, imperial endeavor. They were happy to receive British support in 1917, and then subsequently when the British ruled Palestine for twenty, thirty years, but they weren't part of the British imperial design or mission. They wanted a state for themselves. The Jews, happy to have the British support them, happy today to have the Americans support Israel.\n\nBut it's not because we're stooges or extensions of American imperial interests. The British, incidentally, always described in Arab, narratives of propaganda as consistent supporters of Zionism. They weren't. The first British rulers in Palestine, 1917, 1920\n\nSpeaker 0: Herbert Samuel.\n\nSpeaker 1: No. Before Herbert Samuel. Samuel came in 1920. The British ruled there for three years previously, and most of the leaders, the British generals and so on, who were in Palestine were anti Zionist. And subsequently, in the twenties and thirties, the British occasionally, curbed Zionist immigration to Palestine.\n\nAnd in 1939, switched horses and supported the Arab national movement and not Zionism. They turned anti Zionist and basically said, you Arabs will rule Palestine within the next ten years. This is what we're giving you by limiting Jewish immigration to Palestine. But the Arabs didn't actually understand what they were being given on a silver platter, Husseini again. And he said, no.\n\nNo. We can't accept the British white paper of May 1939, which had given the Arabs everything they wanted, basically, self determination in an Arab majority state. So what I'm saying is the British, at some point, did support the Zionist enterprise, but at other points were less consistent than the support. And in 1939 until 1948 when they didn't vote even for partition for Jewish statehood in Palestine in the UN resolution, they didn't support Zionism during the last decade of the mandate. It's worth remembering that.\n\nSpeaker 0: I I'd like to respond to that. I mean, speaking of propaganda, I find it simply impossible to accept, that Balfour, who as British prime minister in nineteen o five was a chief sponsor of the Aliens Act, which was specifically He\n\nSpeaker 1: changed his mind.\n\nSpeaker 0: Which was specifically designed to keep\n\nSpeaker 1: To keep\n\nSpeaker 0: up Jewish. Persecuted Eastern European Jews out of the streets\n\nSpeaker 1: So he changed his mind.\n\nSpeaker 0: And who was denounced as an antisemite by the entire British Jewish establishment. A decade later, all of a sudden\n\nSpeaker 1: Changed his mind. The\n\nSpeaker 0: people change their minds. But when the when when when the changing of the mind just coincidentally happens to coincide, with the British imperial interest, I think perhaps the transformation is is is a little more superficial than he's being given credit for. It it was clearly a British imperial venture, and if there had been no threat to the Suez Canal during World War one, regardless of what Balfour would have thought about the Jews and their contribution to, history and their and their persecution and so on, there would have been no Balfour there.\n\nSpeaker 4: And that's real quick as a question on that. Why did the British ever cap immigration then from Jews to that area at all?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, we're talking now about 2019\n\nSpeaker 4: sure. But I'm saying that if it was if the whole goal was just to be an imperialist project, like, there were terrorist attacks from Jewish, firms.\n\nSpeaker 0: But you're you're so I'll answer\n\nSpeaker 4: you. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: And we're talking now about 1917. And and as I mentioned earlier, I don't think the British had a Jewish state in mind. That's why they used the term Jewish national home. I think what they wanted was a British protectorate, loyal to and dependent upon, the British. I think an outstanding, review of British policy towards these issues during the mandate has been done by Martin Bunton of the University of Victoria.\n\nAnd and he basically makes the argument, that once the British realized the mess they were in, certainly by the late twenties, early thirties, they they recognized these the mess they were in, the irreconcilable differences, and basically pursued a policy of just muddling on. And and, and muddling on in the context of British rule in Palestine, whose overall purpose was to serve, for the development of of Zionist institutions, Yeshiva's economy, and so on, meant, even if the British, were not self consciously doing this, preparing the groundwork for the eventual establishment of a Jewish state. I don't know if that answers your question.\n\nSpeaker 1: Except they did turn anti Zionist\n\nSpeaker 0: in 1939. Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Of course.\n\nSpeaker 4: Of course. Of course.\n\nSpeaker 1: Of course. Of course. They were\n\nSpeaker 0: being shot off by\n\nSpeaker 1: And maintained that Zionist no. No. Before they were being shot off, but maintained that anti Zionist posture until 1948.\n\nSpeaker 3: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: And and if I may, just also one point. You mentioned Haj Amin al Husseini during a world entirely legitimate. But what I but what I would also point point out is that you had a Zionist organization, the Leahy.\n\nSpeaker 1: 300 people.\n\nSpeaker 0: 300 people, one of whom happened to become an Israeli prime minister, an Israeli foreign minister, speaker of Israeli parliament.\n\nSpeaker 3: Maybe you should give his name.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yitzhak Shamir, proposing an alliance with Nazi Germany in 1941.\n\nSpeaker 1: Shamir proposed\n\nSpeaker 0: the Well, no. The Leahy proposed.\n\nSpeaker 1: Some people in the Leahy proposed\n\nSpeaker 0: Of which Shamir was a prominent\n\nSpeaker 1: leader. Herring also.\n\nSpeaker 0: No. No. Okay. Well, if he's a red herring,\n\nSpeaker 1: had to be seen as a red whale.\n\nSpeaker 0: I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 1: The Lekki was an unimportant organization in the issue. 300 people versus 30,000 belong to the Haganah. So it was not a very important organization. It's true. Before the Holocaust actually began, they wanted allies against the British where they could find\n\nSpeaker 3: them in\n\nSpeaker 1: the end of the nineteenth. 41\n\nSpeaker 0: here, not 1931. 40. 41 from what I recall.\n\nSpeaker 1: 1940. They were they approached the the The the emissary in Istanbul\n\nSpeaker 0: or something.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Istanbul.\n\nSpeaker 0: And and and if I may, proposed an alliance with Nazi Germany on what the Leahy described as on the basis of shared ideological shared ideological principles. Well, they said they did.\n\nSpeaker 1: No. They did revile Why are you doing these things? Of course. Said you know\n\nSpeaker 3: the state, but you know that vile. You know what the statement said on the basis of a shared ideology. Why do you say no?\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you think that the\n\nSpeaker 3: Mexicans wait.\n\nSpeaker 1: The Mexicans say we're Nazis. Is that what they're saying?\n\nSpeaker 0: They said\n\nSpeaker 3: you say that.\n\nSpeaker 1: No. You're saying that. Forget statements. You like to quote things, but were they were they Nazis?\n\nSpeaker 3: Quote facts.\n\nSpeaker 1: Where are the where are the Nazi Nazis? That's what I'm asking.\n\nSpeaker 3: What did he say? Some of them said\n\nSpeaker 1: what did\n\nSpeaker 3: Stalin say incident basis of the pact? Was there agreement on ideology?\n\nSpeaker 1: There wasn't any pact. They suggested.\n\nSpeaker 3: I said it was agreement. And what did the agreement say?\n\nSpeaker 1: They wanted arms against the British.\n\nSpeaker 3: That's what they\n\nSpeaker 1: wanted to do.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, that's what Hoseidon and Hosseini wanted also. That's what No. No. But they they didn't work in India.\n\nSpeaker 1: People didn't work in Berlin, helping the Nazi regime. I mean, that's\n\nSpeaker 0: what the IRA wanted also.\n\nSpeaker 1: But this is what Khatramina Ali Amina Husseini did. You know that he was an anti Semite. You've probably read some of his works. Yeah. He wasn't just anti British.\n\nSpeaker 0: And and He\n\nSpeaker 1: was also anti Semitic.\n\nSpeaker 0: And and the\n\nSpeaker 1: They had a common ground with Hitler.\n\nSpeaker 3: I I think I think we can agree. Every anti Semite is a Hitlerite. I think we could part\n\nSpeaker 4: He literally worked with the Nazis to recruit people. He wasn't just a guy posting or\n\nSpeaker 3: absolutely revolting, disgusting human beings. This I'm happy\n\nSpeaker 1: to hear.\n\nSpeaker 2: No. But the problem is you're inquiring.\n\nSpeaker 4: You're saying that Hussein was his influence. You're saying the movie was\n\nSpeaker 3: I I don't even understand. Of all the crimes you want to ascribe to the Palestinian people, trying to blame them directly, indirectly, indirectly, or indirectly, three times removed for the Nazi holocaust is completely lunatic.\n\nSpeaker 4: Hold on. The wait. There's not a he's not blaming them for the holocaust. He's saying that from the perspective wait. Wait.\n\nWait. No. He's saying that from the perspective of Jews in the region, Palestinians would have been part of the region. That is exactly what he said.\n\nSpeaker 3: I've read him.\n\nSpeaker 4: You never understand\n\nSpeaker 2: him. He's just right\n\nSpeaker 3: here. Believe me. I'm a lot more literate than you, mister Barrelli.\n\nSpeaker 2: Believe the guy that wrote the stuff. The Wikipedia said. That's great.\n\nSpeaker 3: I read that he's Hebrew.\n\nSpeaker 4: You call yourself an Israeli historian. I I I wrong. You're on a different ground.\n\nSpeaker 0: I just want if I can just respond to\n\nSpeaker 4: No. No. No. I'm just saying that the there there were two there were two tricks. There were that's fine.\n\nThere were two tricks that are being played here that I think is interesting. One is you guys claim that the Leahy was trying to forge an alliance with Nazi Germany because of a shared ideology. That's what they said. Yeah. But hold on.\n\nNo. No. No. No. No.\n\nNo. No. It's about what you said. You brought that up to imply that Zionism must be inexorably linked\n\nSpeaker 0: to no. I'm sorry. Wait. No. You're putting words in my mouth.\n\nNo. No.\n\nSpeaker 4: No. Okay. Wait. Well, then what was the purpose of of saying that the Lehi claimed that they the Lehi who were\n\nSpeaker 0: The reason I called the\n\nSpeaker 4: people that were reviled by many in Israel\n\nSpeaker 1: In not many, by everybody practically.\n\nSpeaker 4: They were called terrorists.\n\nSpeaker 3: So reviled.\n\nSpeaker 1: Communist movement called them terrorists.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yes. Yes. And and Hamid And Hamid, the premier of Shamir called himself a terrorist. They were so irrelevant that their leader ended up being kicked upstairs to the leader of the Israeli parliament That's\n\nSpeaker 1: Israeli parliament\n\nSpeaker 0: to the Israel\n\nSpeaker 1: years in.\n\nSpeaker 0: To Israeli foreign minister.\n\nSpeaker 4: And And also a par Yes.\n\nSpeaker 0: You wanna you wanna characterize him as irrelevant as well? Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 4: No. Characterizing him as relevant or irrelevant based on what happens decades later. The timeline matters. Well The question is, what is the point of saying that the Lahey tried to forge an alliance with\n\nSpeaker 0: a wall of solidarity? Why is\n\nSpeaker 3: why is irrelevant is bringing up the Mufti of Jerusalem and trying to blame the Holocaust\n\nSpeaker 1: No. No. No. No. No.\n\nNo. No. No. No. The Mufti was the leader of the Palestine Arab national movement.\n\nThe Iraqi was triumphed.\n\nSpeaker 3: And he had as much to do with the Nazi Holocaust as I did.\n\nSpeaker 1: No. He recruited people for the SS. How can you get away from them?\n\nSpeaker 3: No. He recruited soldiers People for the SS. He recruited soldiers in the Balkans, mostly Kosovars, which was disgusting. I have no doubt about that. But he had one He don't let any foreign major one\n\nSpeaker 1: said say don't let the Jews out. I do not\n\nSpeaker 3: want him to stop talking about the murder. I do not want to\n\nSpeaker 1: stop talking about the received letters from Husseini during during the Holocaust.\n\nSpeaker 3: Once said\n\nSpeaker 1: During the Holocaust, don't let the Jews out. Don't let the Jews out. I'm not saying he was a major architect of the holocaust.\n\nSpeaker 3: Minor. But if we're\n\nSpeaker 0: agreed statements. If we're agreed Yes. That Haj Amin al Husseini, the Mufti of Jerusalem, collaborated with the Nazis during World War two and actively sought their sponsorship. Why is it irrelevant?\n\nSpeaker 1: And probably wanted the destruction of European Jewry.\n\nSpeaker 0: He probably wanted a lot of things.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay? If that's relevant, why is it irrelevant that a prime minister of Israel\n\nSpeaker 1: Not prime minister. Nineteen forty forty one, he wasn't prime minister of Israel. He was a leader of a very small terrorist\n\nSpeaker 0: So do you consider terrorists terrorist by the name of Zionists. Do you consider it irrelevant that many years ago, Mahmoud Abbas wrote a doctoral thesis, which is basically tantamount\n\nSpeaker 1: about Mahmoud Abbas. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 4: But But\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't but didn't bring it up. You're the one who's bringing it\n\nSpeaker 4: up. Yes. I'm\n\nSpeaker 0: But you consider that one?\n\nSpeaker 1: Belittling the holocaust. That's what you're saying. The president president of the Palestinian National Authority belittled the holocaust and it didn't happen or only a few Jews died.\n\nSpeaker 0: That's a fair characterization of But I didn't bring it up. I brought it up. Yeah. Okay? Because my question is, then why is Shamir's antecedency relevant?\n\nSpeaker 1: He he was a terrorist leader of a very small marginal group. But because Shamir is he was the head of the movement at the time.\n\nSpeaker 4: Also, the the point of bringing it misunderstanding. The point of bringing it Husseini's stuff wasn't to say that he was a great further of the holocaust. It's that he might have been a great further in the prevention of Jews fleeing to go to Palestine to escape the holocaust.\n\nSpeaker 0: That was\n\nSpeaker 4: the that was the point.\n\nSpeaker 0: That and I explained why I think, that's that's not an entirely, accurate characterization. But and then I wanted to make another point. If it's legitimate to bring up his role during World War two, why is it illegitimate to bring up a man who would become Israel's speaker of parliament, foreign minister\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Four years since.\n\nSpeaker 0: Why is it and and also\n\nSpeaker 1: He was young.\n\nSpeaker 0: And was also responsible for the murder of of the United Nations' first international envoy, Bernadotte, Focke Bernadotte. Why is all that irrelevant?\n\nSpeaker 4: I don't think anybody can see what it is. I think that the just the the reason why he was brought up was because Jewish people at the in this time period would have viewed it as, there's a prevention of Jews leaving Europe because of the Palestinians pressuring the British to put a curb that 75,000, immigration limit. Yes. But it's not about, like, it's not about them furthering the holocaust or being an architect, major minor play in the holocaust. Well, I actually We use a major play in that region.\n\nSo what is going on, like\n\nSpeaker 0: Morris was specific made the specific claim that the Palestinians played an indirect role in the Holocaust.\n\nSpeaker 4: The indirect role would have been the prevention of people escaping from\n\nSpeaker 0: Yes. Your And and my response to that is, first of all, I I disagree with that characterization. But second of all\n\nSpeaker 1: disagree with that. They prevented they forced the British to prevent immigration of Jews from Europe and reaching safe shores in Palestine.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, again they did. Again, was And they knew that the Was Palestine\n\nSpeaker 1: been persecuted in Europe. Was\n\nSpeaker 0: Palestine the only spot of land on Earth?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Basically, that was the problem. The Jews couldn't enter\n\nSpeaker 0: the Europe. What about your great friends in Britain, the architects of of the Balfour Declaration?\n\nSpeaker 1: By the late nineteen thirties\n\nSpeaker 0: What about The United States?\n\nSpeaker 3: Happy to\n\nSpeaker 1: take in Jews and the Americans?\n\nSpeaker 0: And and and why and why are Palestinians, who were not Europeans, who had zero role in the rise of Nazism, who had no relation to any of this, why are they somehow uniquely responsible for what happened in Europe and uniquely to cope\n\nSpeaker 1: with the only safe haven for Jews.\n\nSpeaker 3: That's true. Really, The United States wasn't a say a potential stay safe haven. The only one was Palestine. At the party The United States had no room from the Atlantic Pacific for Jews.\n\nSpeaker 1: It did have room, but it didn't So\n\nSpeaker 3: that wasn't the But it didn't want safe haven.\n\nSpeaker 0: This is something be focusing your anger\n\nSpeaker 1: should be blamed for not letting Jews in during the thirties. Are blamed,\n\nSpeaker 3: but nobody blames them for the holocaust. Well, indirectly, indirectly I've never heard it said that Franklin Delano Roosevelt was indirectly responsible for the holocaust. I never heard that. Now maybe it's in Israeli literature because the Israelis have gone mad. Your yes.\n\nYour prime minister said the whole idea of the gas chambers came from the Mufti of Jerusalem. That's nonsense. Yeah. We all know that. Nonsense.\n\nBut we also know that Netanyahu said\n\nSpeaker 1: Netanyahu says Netanyahu says so many things which are And\n\nSpeaker 0: he happens to be the prime minister of Israel.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can't be responsible for them.\n\nSpeaker 0: Not responsible for them, but it is relevant that he is the longest serving prime minister of Israel. Unfortunately, he says\n\nSpeaker 1: that about the Israeli public. Right?\n\nSpeaker 0: And he gets and he gets selected, not despite saying such things, but because he says\n\nSpeaker 1: such His voters don't care about Hajime al Husseini or Hitler. They know nothing about his voters.\n\nSpeaker 0: Be right.\n\nSpeaker 1: His base know nothing about know nothing about anything. And he can say what he likes, and they'll say yes, so they don't care if he\n\nSpeaker 0: says these things. You may well be right. But but but, anyway, not to beat a dead horse, but I don't I I still don't understand.\n\nSpeaker 1: Dead horse.\n\nSpeaker 0: You're right. I I'll just conclude by saying, I don't understand why the Mufti of Jerusalem is relevant.\n\nSpeaker 1: He is relevant. He is\n\nSpeaker 3: relevant.
